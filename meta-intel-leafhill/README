meta-intel-leafhill
===================

This is the location for Intel IoTG PED maintained BSPs.

Please see the README files contained in the individual BSP layers for
BSP-specific information. For details on the intel-common BSPs, see the
conf/machine/README file.

If you have problems with or questions about a particular BSP, please
contact the maintainer listed in the MAINTAINERS file directly, but
please try to do the following first:

  - look through known issues list in the BSP Release Notes to see if the
    same problem has already been reported.

  - contact IoTG PED customer support team for more details.
    Contact: Mok Kim Hoe <kim.hoe.mok@intel.com>

If you believe you have encountered a bug, you can contact IoTG PED
customer support team and cc meta-intel-leafhill maintainer.

Intel-specific machine features
===============================

The meta-intel-leafhill layer makes some additional machine features
available to BSPs.  These machine features can be used in a BSP layer in the
same way that machine features are used in other layers based on
oe-core, via the MACHINE_FEATURES variable.

Requirements
------------

The meta-intel-leafhill machine features are only available to a BSP
when the meta-intel-leafhill layer is included in the build configuration, and
the meta-intel.inc file is included in the machine configuration of
that BSP.

To make these features available for your machine, you will need to:

  1. include a configuration line such as the below in bblayers.conf
	BBLAYERS += "<local path>/meta-intel-leafhill"
  2. include the following line in the machine configuration file
	require conf/machine/include/meta-intel.inc

Once the above requirements are met, the machine features provided by
the meta-intel-leafhill layer will be available for the BSP to use.
