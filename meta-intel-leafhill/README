===================

This is the location for Intel IoTG PED customizations for Yocto BSPs.

Please see the README files contained in the individual BSP layers for
BSP-specific information. For details on the intel-common BSPs, see the
conf/machine/README file.

If you have problems with or questions about a particular BSP, please
contact the maintainer listed in the MAINTAINERS file directly, but
please try to do the following first:

  - look through known issues list in the BSP Release Notes to see if the
    same problem has already been reported.

  - contact IoTG PED customer support team for more details.

customer support team and cc meta-intel-leafhill maintainer.

Once the above requirements are met, the machine features provided by
the meta-intel-leafhill layer will be available for the BSP to use.
