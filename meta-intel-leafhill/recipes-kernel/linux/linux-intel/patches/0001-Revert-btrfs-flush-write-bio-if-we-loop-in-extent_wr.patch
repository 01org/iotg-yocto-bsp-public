Subject: [PATCH] Revert "btrfs: flush write bio if we loop in
 extent_write_cache_pages"

This reverts commit 860473714cbe7fbedcf92bfe3eb6d69fae8c74ff.  That
has an incorrect upstream commit reference, and was modified in a way
that conflicts with some older fixes.  We can cleanly cherry-pick the
upstream commit *after* those fixes.
